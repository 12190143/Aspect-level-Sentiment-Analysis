[t]excellent camera 
##this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models . 
use[+1],quality[+2],size[+1]##the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use, high quality, and compact in size . 
##with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation . 
auto-setting[+2]##the auto-setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them . 
##if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300 , i would order another just like it .

[t]perfect consumer digital camera 
camera[+2]##if you do any research into digital cameras , you 'll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there . 
##these are the reasons i think it 's great : 
##it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want . 
##it is easy enough for my grandmother to use . 
size[+2],control[+2],use[+2]##The size is very compact but the control is so well designed that they 're still easy to use . 
##it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms . 
cards[+1]##for " digital film " it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome . 
support[+1]##the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model . 
picture-quality[+2]##picture-quality is excellent . 
battery-life[+2]##battery-life is excellent . 
zoom[+2]##3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range . 
price[+2]##great price for all the features . 
##here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera : 
firewire[-1]##no direct firewire to the camera . 
##there is usb , though . 
viewfinder[-1]##the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured . 
##this does n't affect the picture , of course . 
##you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture . 
##it 's no problem for me personally .
