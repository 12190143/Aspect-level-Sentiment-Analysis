[t]excellent picture quality / color 
canon powershot g3[+3]##i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase . 
use[+2],camera[+2]##the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group . 
##after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us . 
##i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way . 
picture[+2]##they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) . 
quality[+1]##a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality . 
quality[+1]##i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 * 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) . 
##ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras . 
camera[+2],use[+2],feature[+1]##bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices . 
pictures[+3],use[+1],options[+1],flexibility[+1]##i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like . 
##great job canon ! 
[t]canon g3 ? incredible camera 
##i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras .  
g3[+1]##following my research , i decided on the g3 . 
camera[+3]##in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera . 
speed[+2],quality[+2],conveniences[+2],flexibility[+2],automation[+2]##i won't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers . 
settings[+2],picture[+2]##with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet . 
##and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image . 
camera[+3],quality[+3],canon[+1]##i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 . 
##do n't walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will not be disappointed . 
[t]great camera 
g3[+3]##i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied . 
quality[+2]##i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality . 
features[+2]##the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds . 
##flaws ? 
viewfinder[-1],lens[-1],use[-1]##the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me . 
canon[-1]##still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera . 
canon[+2]##despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 to anyone who is serious about digital photography . 
[t]fantastic digital camera 
features[+2], ##the camera has a wonderful set of features . 
lcd[+2]##the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures . 
##you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd . 
zoom[+2]##the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry . 
zoom[+3]##the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect . 
pictures[+3]##i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased . 
software[+2],use[+2]##the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use . 
lens cap[-1],viewfinder[-1]##the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) . 
menus[+1],buttons[+1],use[+1]##the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use . 
camera[+3],price[+3]##it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price . 
[t]the best of everything 
cameras[+3],g3[+3]##recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available . 
control[+2]##advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable . 
setting[+2],pictures[+2]##newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box . 
##do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype . 
##unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it . 
g3[+2]##those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use . 
##anyone looking for more than " point and shoot " can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference . 
range[+2],lense[+2]##the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class . 
##i expect the g3 will please me for years to come . 
[t]pure class & quality - a work of craftmanship 
camera[+3],price[+3]##i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period ! 
pictures[+3],controls[+2],battery[+2],software[+2]##it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing . 
quality[+2],auto mode[+2]##i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode . 
##absolutely breathtaking . 
##i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out . 
##i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb . 
canon[+3]##i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon .
